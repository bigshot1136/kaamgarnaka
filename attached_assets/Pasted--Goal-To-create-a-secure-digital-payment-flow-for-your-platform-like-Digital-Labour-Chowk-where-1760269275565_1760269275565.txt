🎯 Goal

To create a secure digital payment flow for your platform (like Digital Labour Chowk) where:

The customer pays for services through your platform.

The payment is held temporarily (escrow) until you release it.

The worker sees their balance in a dashboard and can withdraw anytime.

Both the customer and the worker are charged an additional ₹10 convenience fee each, which is credited directly and permanently to your company’s account.

⚙️ Complete Flow Explanation
🧩 Step 1: Customer Payment

A customer books a worker for a service worth ₹1000.

At checkout, your platform automatically adds ₹10 customer convenience charge.

Total customer payment = ₹1010.

The customer pays using Razorpay Checkout (UPI, card, net banking, etc.).

The full ₹1010 is received by your company’s Razorpay Route account.

💰 Step 2: Fund Allocation (Escrow Logic)

Your backend then processes and allocates the funds as follows:

₹1000 = Service amount (belongs to worker, held in escrow).

₹10 (customer) + ₹10 (worker) = ₹20 total convenience charge → this goes permanently to your company’s balance.

So after each booking:

Source	Amount	Destination
Customer Payment	₹1010	Platform Account
Worker Convenience Fee	₹10 (deducted later)	Platform Account
Worker Receivable	₹990	Worker Wallet Balance
Platform Earnings (Total)	₹20	Company Account
💼 Step 3: Worker Dashboard (Wallet System)

When the worker logs in:

They can view:

Total Earnings (₹990 from this job)

Platform Fee Deducted (₹10)

Available Balance (₹990)

Withdrawal Button

👉 The worker’s “Available Balance” is stored in your database ledger and synced with Razorpay Route or RazorpayX balance.

💳 Step 4: Worker Withdrawal (Payout System)

When the worker clicks “Withdraw,” your backend triggers a RazorpayX Payout API call.

₹990 is transferred instantly to the worker’s bank account or UPI.

Razorpay deducts small payout fees (₹2–₹5).

Worker receives SMS/email confirmation from Razorpay.

The ₹10 convenience charge (worker’s side) remains in your company account — it is not deducted from the withdrawal but already handled during allocation.

🧾 Step 5: Platform (Company) Revenue Tracking

Your company account will automatically accumulate the following:

₹10 per customer + ₹10 per worker = ₹20 per transaction.

If you have 100 daily transactions → ₹2,000 daily convenience revenue.

You can track this from the Admin Dashboard:

Total Earnings (Platform Revenue)

Total Worker Withdrawals

Total Transactions

Settlement Reports (auto-generated by Razorpay)

🔒 Compliance and Legal Note

Razorpay Route and RazorpayX operate under RBI-compliant escrow/nodal accounts — safe for handling third-party funds.

Workers must complete KYC verification before first payout (Razorpay will handle this).

The ₹10 convenience charge is considered platform revenue, so you can include it in your GST filings.
